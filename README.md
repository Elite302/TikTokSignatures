# TikTokSignatures

# What is this used for?

X-Gorgon & X-Ladon are custom headers, injected by TikTok. They inject these so
called custom headers to prevent any disallowed activties on the endpoints.

Every request needs a new X-Gorgon & X-Ladon, these two scripts easily generate this.
Using this you could use the endpoints, generating these custom headers.

Other then that, there's not much you can do with this.
